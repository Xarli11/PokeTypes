# PokeTypes Roadmap 🚀

This document outlines the planned features, improvements, and future vision for the PokeTypes application.

## 📋 Upcoming Features

### 1. Export Analysis as Image 📸 (Priority)
Generate a high-quality PNG image of the current type analysis to easily share on social media (Discord, Twitter, etc.).

### 2. Move Effectiveness Calculator ⚔️
Input a specific move (e.g., Earthquake) and see how it performs against different type combinations.

### 3. PokeAnalyzer (Pokemon Details) 🔍
Expand the application from a type calculator to a quick-reference tool for competitive and casual play.

*   **Phase 3: Learnsets (Long-term)**
    *   Display moves learned by leveling up, TMs, and Egg moves.
    *   *Note: This requires significant data optimization.*

### 4. Team Coverage Tool 🛡️
Analyze a full team of up to 6 Pokemon to identify shared weaknesses and type coverage gaps.

## 🛠️ Technical Improvements

*   **Data Optimization:** Split `pokedex.json` into smaller chunks or use a more efficient compression if it grows significantly with stats/moves.
*   **Advanced Caching:** Improve Service Worker logic to handle larger assets (images) more efficiently.
*   **Localization:** Support for Spanish, Japanese, and other languages for Pokemon names and UI elements.
